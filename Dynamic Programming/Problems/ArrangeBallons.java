//    Phonepe | PSDS | Find Number of ways to arrange ballons
//Your friend's birthday is nearby. He asked you to take care of balloon decoration. He has bought
//    White and Yellow balloons of N and M quantities respectively. You have to decorate the balloons by placing the balloons in a straight line in any order. He likes a decoration when there are no more than W white balloons placed successively or there are no more than Y yellow balloons placed successively.
//
//    Your friend wants to know the number of decorations that are possible from given input such that he likes the decorations.
//
//            Note: A line filled with balloons in any order is considered as a decoration.
//
//            Input
//    The first and the only line contains four space separated integers N, M, W, Y
//1 <= N, M <= 100
//            1 <= W,Y <=10
//
//    Output:
//    Print the number of decorations your friend will like modulo 100000000
//
//    Test case 1
//
//            2 1 1 10
//
//    Output: 1
//
//    Only possible way to arrange is “white, yellow, white”
//
//    Note: “white, white, yellow” or “yellow, white, white” not possible because we cannot have more than 1 white.
//
//            Test case 2
//
//            2 3 1 2
//
//    Output: 5
